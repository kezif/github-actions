I created this project to  to get fancy github test passing badge and git familiar with github action.

Also to get more knowledge on fastapi + sqlalchemy stack

In fact and got bored and ask chatgpt for example project that i could unit test and wrore it. 

Unfortunatly Deta Space hosting uses it's own nosql engine and doesnt support sqlalchemy stuff. On the other hand I could setup github action to push to deta server on commit. So win win
